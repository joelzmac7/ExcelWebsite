# Database Management Configuration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for completing the database management configuration for the Excel Medical Staffing AI Platform. The goal is to ensure robust database management procedures for production readiness, including automated backups, monitoring, maintenance, and data retention policies.

## Current Status
We have several database management scripts in the `src/infrastructure/scripts` directory:
- `backup-database.sh` - Script for backing up PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases
- `db-monitor.sh` - Script for monitoring database performance and health
- `db-maintenance.sh` - Script for performing routine maintenance tasks
- `db-backup.sh` - Alternative backup script
- `monitor-database.sh` - Alternative monitoring script

These scripts provide a foundation for database management but need to be completed, tested, and properly integrated into the system.

## Action Items

### 1. Complete Automated Database Backup Script Implementation
- [x] Review existing backup scripts (`backup-database.sh` and `db-backup.sh`)
- [ ] Consolidate into a single, comprehensive backup solution
- [ ] Add error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Implement backup verification
- [ ] Add logging and notification improvements
- [ ] Create a backup rotation strategy
- [ ] Set up automated scheduling with cron jobs
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures

### 2. Implement Data Retention Policies
- [ ] Define retention periods for different data categories
- [ ] Implement automated data archiving for historical data
- [ ] Create data purging procedures for expired data
- [ ] Develop audit logging for data lifecycle events
- [ ] Implement compliance checks for healthcare data regulations
- [ ] Create scripts for enforcing retention policies
- [ ] Set up scheduled jobs for retention policy enforcement

### 3. Configure Database Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Review existing monitoring scripts (`db-monitor.sh` and `monitor-database.sh`)
- [ ] Consolidate into a single, comprehensive monitoring solution
- [ ] Set up performance baselines for normal operation
- [ ] Configure alerting thresholds for key metrics
- [ ] Implement trend analysis for proactive monitoring
- [ ] Set up dashboard for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Create automated performance reports
- [ ] Configure integration with monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)

### 4. Create Database Maintenance Scripts
- [ ] Review existing maintenance script (`db-maintenance.sh`)
- [ ] Enhance with additional maintenance procedures
- [ ] Implement index optimization routines
- [ ] Add query performance analysis
- [ ] Create procedures for handling database growth
- [ ] Implement automated schema updates
- [ ] Set up scheduled maintenance windows
- [ ] Create rollback procedures for failed maintenance

### 5. Set Up Monitoring Alerts and Notifications
- [ ] Configure email alerts for critical database events
- [ ] Set up Slack notifications for operational teams
- [ ] Implement escalation procedures for unresolved issues
- [ ] Create alert suppression for maintenance windows
- [ ] Set up on-call rotation integration
- [ ] Implement alert aggregation to prevent alert fatigue
- [ ] Create custom alert templates for different scenarios

### 6. Create Documentation for Database Management Procedures
- [ ] Document backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Create runbooks for common database operations
- [ ] Document monitoring and alerting configuration
- [ ] Create maintenance procedure documentation
- [ ] Document data retention policies and procedures
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [ ] Document disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Create training materials for database administrators

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Backup and Monitoring
- Days 1-2: Complete and test backup scripts
- Days 3-4: Configure monitoring and alerting
- Day 5: Set up scheduled jobs and verify operation

### Week 2: Maintenance and Retention
- Days 1-2: Complete maintenance scripts
- Days 3-4: Implement data retention policies
- Day 5: Test and verify all procedures

### Week 3: Documentation and Training
- Days 1-3: Create comprehensive documentation
- Days 4-5: Conduct training and knowledge transfer

## Success Criteria
- All database management scripts are fully implemented and tested
- Automated backups are running successfully with verification
- Monitoring is providing actionable insights with appropriate alerting
- Maintenance procedures are running without issues
- Data retention policies are enforced correctly
- Documentation is complete and accessible to the team
- Operations team is trained on all database management procedures
